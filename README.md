# Dual-Clock-Asynchronous-FIFO
Designed Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog, synthesised &amp; verified the design in Xilinx Vivado. ◦ Synchronization of FIFO pointers is accomplished using Gray Code to avoid multi-bit signal transitions. ◦ Implemented 2 Flip-Flop Synchronizer to avoid meta-stability issues in CDC.
